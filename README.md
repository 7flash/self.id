## Local development

- `npm run ceramic` to start the Ceramic daemon
- `npm run bootstrap` to publish the schemas to the Ceramic node, create a definition and set it to the local IDX doc
- `npm run dev` to start the Next development server

The local IDX doc should be accessible on `http://localhost:3000/did:3...` using the DID logged by the `bootstrap` script
